    "\n",
    "The `mailcom` package is used to anonymize/pseudonymize textual data, i.e. email content or more general text provided as a tabular input. It takes an `eml`, `html` or `csv` file as input and extracts information about attachements, number of attachements and type, and the content of the email body and subject line. The email body and subject line are then parsed through [`spaCy`](https://spacy.io/) and divided into sentences. The sentences are fed to a [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) named entity recognition (NER) [pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.46.3/en/main_classes/pipelines), and person names, places, organizations, miscellaneous, are detected in the inference task. Names are replaced by pseudonyms, while locations, organizations and miscellaneous are replaced by `[location]`, `[organization]` and `[misc]`. The text is further parsed using string methods, to replace any numbers with `[number]` and email addresses with `[email]`. The processed text and metadata can then be written to an `xml` file or into a pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mailcom` can automatically detect the (dominant) text language and also has the capability of preserving dates in the text (so that only numbers are replaced, but not patterns that match dates).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that 100% accuracy is not possible with this task. Any output needs to be further checked by a human to ensure the text has been anonymized completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current set-up is for Romance languages, however [other language models](https://spacy.io/usage/models) can also be loaded into the spaCy pipeline. The transformers pipeline uses the `xlm-roberta-large-finetuned-conll03-english` model revision number `18f95e9` by default, but other models can also be passed via the config file (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the `mailcom` package, please install it into your conda environment using\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install mailcom\n",
    "```\n",
    "After that, select the appropriate kernel for your Jupyter notebook and execute the cells below to import the package. The package is currently under active development and any function calls are subject to changes.\n",

    "\n",
    "These keywords set the options for the main processes of the `mailcom` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default language\n",
    " The default language can be used for text that is always in the same language, that is, each `eml`/`html` file or row of the `csv` contains data in the same language. If this is the case, processing is much faster. If not, the language of the text can be detected on-the-fly: In this case, leave the default language empty, ie. `\"\"` an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudonymization settings\n",
    "The keywords `pseudo_emailaddresses` and `pseudo_numbers` are by default set to `true`, which triggers the replacement of email addresses such as email@gmail.com by [email], and numbers such as 69120 by [number].\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `pseudo_ne`, the replacement of recognized entities by a pseudonym or spaceholder is triggered. A person's name, i.e. \"Michael\" is replaced by a pseudonym, for example, \"James\", a location like \"Paris\" is replaced by [location], an organization such as \"GitHub\" is replaced by [organization], and other entities like \"iPhone 15\" are replaced by [misc].\n",
    "\n",
    "All these three options related to replacement of identifying information can be triggered separately, but are set to `true` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that same person names are replaced by same pseudonyms without considering gender. The pseudonyms that are used can be changed as detailed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic language detection\n",
    "The keyword `lang_detection_lib` determines the settings for the dynamic detection of the language. While this increases the processing time, it is crucial for correct sentence splitting when multiple languages are present in the data (i.e., one file is Spanish and one French, or some rows of the `csv` files contain text in a different language). In principle, the language can be determined for each sentence; but the general use of this capability is language detection per `eml`/`html` file/row in the `csv` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note that the default language must not be set for this option to be triggered (`default_lang=\"\"`)!** \n",
    "\n",
    "Three different libraries are available for language detection, [`langid`](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py), [`langdetect`](https://github.com/Mimino666/langdetect), [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/papluca/xlm-roberta-base-language-detection), that all lead to a similar performance on our test set. With the language detected dynamically, the spaCy model for sentence splitting is also set dynamically based on the detected language for each file/row; this should be combined with the `default` option for the spaCy model in order to work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datetime detection\n",
    "Using the keyword `datetime_detection`, `mailcom` can detect patterns that match dates, such as \"09 février 2009\" or \"April 17th 2024\" for `\"non-strict\"` parsing. These patterns can then be protected from the replacement of numbers, which would result in (for these examples) \"[number] février [number]\" or \"April [number]th [number]\". This feature could be important in texts in which chronology is not easy to follow, or where it is important to retain any information about time in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting the `time_parsing` to `\"strict\"`, only precise date-time formats such as \"17. April 2024 um 16:58:57\" or \"17.04.2024 17:33:23\" are detected, not using the more flexible pattern matching rules as in \"April 17th 2024\". This option could be useful for identifying forwarded dates within email bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected models and model pipelines\n",
    "The transformers pipeline specifies which tasks the LLMs should carry out, and which models and revision numbers should be used. Here is an example for the transformers pipeline, with the default options:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"ner\": {\n",
    "    \"task\": \"token-classification\",\n",
    "    \"model\": \"xlm-roberta-large-finetuned-conll03-english\",\n",
    "    \"revision\": \"18f95e9\",\n",
    "    \"aggregation_strategy\": \"simple\",\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The task is `token-classification`, which is NER (for a description of the available tasks, see [here]((https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines))). The default model is Hugging Face's default model for this task and default revision number as of January 2025. The aggregation strategy determines how the tokens are aggregated after the pipeline; with `simple` the text is basically reconstructed as it was and the beginning and end of each recognized NER is given in accordance. The options `task` and `aggregation_strategy` are not likely to be changed by the user, however you may want to use a different model and revision number, which is possible using the `ner_pipeline` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword `spacy_model` sets the model to use for the sentencizing and pattern recognition. It is important that the initial text is split into sentences with a high accuracy, since this directly affects the subsequent NER accuracy. If the keyword is set to `default`, the models that spaCy uses as default for the given language is used. Some of the default models are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"es\": \"es_core_news_md\"\n",
    "\"fr\": \"fr_core_news_md\"\n",
    "\"de\": \"de_core_news_md\"\n",
    "\"pt\": \"pt_core_news_md\"\n",
    "\"en\": \"en_core_web_md\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Other models can directly be passed using this keyword, see the [spaCy reference](https://spacy.io/models). Please also note that not all spaCy models have pipelines with the necessary components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-set pseudonyms\n",
    "First and last names are replaced by pseudonyms. To make the pseudonimized text read more smoothly, names that are common for a specific language can be chosen; but basically any names can be set for any language using the `pseudo_first_names` keyword. The default option is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pseudo_first_names = {\n",
    "        \"es\": [\n",
    "            \"Marta\",\n",
