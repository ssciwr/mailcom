    "# Demonstration notebook for the mailcom package\n",
    "*Scientific Software Center, University of Heidelberg, December 2024*  \n",
    "The `mailcom` package is used to anonymize/pseudonymize textual data, i.e. email content. It takes an `eml` or `html` file as input and extracts information about attachements, number of attachements and type, and the content of the email body. The latter is then parsed through [`spaCy`](https://spacy.io/) and divided into sentences. The sentences are fed to a [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) named entity recognition (NER) [pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.46.3/en/main_classes/pipelines), and person names, places, organizations, miscellaneous, are detected in the inference task. Names are replaced by pseudos, while locations, organizations and miscellaneous are replaced by `[location]`, `[organization]` and `[misc]`. The text is further parsed using string methods, to replace any numbers with `[number]` and email addresses with `[email]`. The processed text and metadata can then be written to an `xml` file or into a pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that 100% accuracy is not possible with this task. Any output needs to be further checked by a human to ensure the text has been anonymized completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current set-up is for Romance languages, however [other language models](https://spacy.io/usage/models) can also be loaded into the spaCy pipeline. The transformers pipeline uses the `xlm-roberta-large-finetuned-conll03-english` model revision number `18f95e9` by default, but other models can also be passed (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the `mailcom` package, please install it into your conda environment using\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install mailcom\n",
    "```\n",
    "After that, select the appropriate kernel for your Jupyter notebook and execute the cell below to import the package. The package is currently under active development and any function calls are subject to changes."
